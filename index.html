            <p> Since I can remember I have always loved the outdoors! 
                I used to enjoy working outside with my dad building things. 
                I treasured the moments I was able to spend outdoors with him. 
                I even built an underground plumbing system out of the leftover PVC pipe from the sprinkler system. 
                This love for the outdoors and adventure definitely carried over to my adult life.</p>
            <p> Before moving to Missouri, my favorite things to do were all at the mountains of New Mexico, the foot hills, the Bosque, and the river. 
                I loved biking, kayaking, hiking and camping. Everything about that adventurous lifestyle calls my name. 
                Putting up or tearing down a tent when its pouring rain, making breakfast on a brisk mountain morning, 
                and most of all, sharing those moments with incredible people that I love. </p>
            <p> One of the most relaxing activities was going kayaking down the Rio Grande. 
                One time, however, the water levels were lower than usual. 
                My friend Jocelyn was in her one person kayak and my friend Bekah and I were in my two person kayak. 
                We were floating down our usual area when we noticed that there was a large drop coming, because of a man made dam. 
                We had traveled over this dam on multiple occasions. Never, however, had the drop been been this big. 
                The drop was somewhere around five to six feet deep. Bekah and I brace ourselves to go down. 
                We kept the kayak as straight as possible to avoid flipping into the river, and down we went. 
                The fall was a little rough but we were both ok. Now it was Jocelyn’s turn. 
                She straightened out her kayak to prepare for it and went for the drop. 
                Initially, it seemed as if everything was going to be ok. When suddenly, we saw her kayak get sucked into the waterfall and then flipped. 
                Thankfully, Jocelyn resurfaced quickly. Everything she had in her kayak did as well and began floating down the river. 
                So , Bekah and I were racing to catch everything that was floating away; hammocks, shoes, a backpack, 
                a soccer ball as well as some other miscellaneous items. 
                It took us a while to recover everything, drain the kayak and get back in the water after this, 
                but it remains one of my favorite stories to this day!</p>
            <p> One of the things that I love about the outdoors is that you never know what you’re going to run into. 
                There is so much to discover and explore. 
                I’ve had the opportunity to go cliff jumping, to sleep outside through thunder storms and hail storms, 
                see a few bears, had a snake crawl up my leg, drink a hot coffee on the edge of a mountain, and the list goes on. </p>
            <article> I can’t wait to see what other adventures come my way!</article>
